# Welcome to Progress Tracker

[Progress Tracker](https://jovial-jalebi-d5c41c.netlify.app/) is a single-page app that utilizes ChartJS to display user input. This repo only contains the front-end because I deployed the front-end and back-end on different sites. You can check out the backend [here](https://github.com/GlenCalica/progress-tracker-backend).

This project puts everything I've learned at school together. From the start of the project, I've had to think about how to design the front-end to smoothly communicate with the back-end to communicate with the database and the other way around. It was definitely a rewarding experience to see everything working together.

As for new concepts, I've learned how to implemment user auth using JWT. Sending a token to a user to store in their local storage and checking that token when sent back tied the whole front-end and back-end together.

## Front-end

-  React
-  React Router
-  TailwindCSS

## Back-end

-  Node JS
-  Express
-  MongoDB
-  Mongoose
-  Bcryptjs
-  REST APIs and CRUD

## Full-stack

-  JWT Authentication and Authorization
