# Welcome to Progress Tracker

[Progress Tracker](https://jovial-jalebi-d5c41c.netlify.app/) is a single-page app that utilizes ChartJS to display user input. This repo only contains the front-end because I deployed the front-end and back-end on different sites. You can check out the backend [here](https://github.com/GlenCalica/progress-tracker-backend).

This was a long project to work on. I've learned a lot of the different technologies needed in classes I've taken at school. However, this project puts everything I've learned together: which is a lot harder than I thought it would be. From the start of the project, I've had to think about how to design the front-end to smoothly communicate with the back-end to communicate with the database and the other way around. It was definitely a rewarding experience to see everything working together.

As for new concepts, implemmenting user auth using JWT was an interesting one. Sending a token to a user to store in their local storage and checking that token when sent back tied the whole front-end and back-end together.

## Front-end
